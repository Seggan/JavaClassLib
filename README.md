# JavaClassLib

This is a Java class file manipulation library that, unlike other bytecode libraries, directly deals with the constructs in the class file without any abstraction. It is still unfinished.

## Todo
- Add the rest of the bytecode instructions
- Add more attributes
- Add interface, field, and attribute capabilities to classes
